	<h1> Approximate Duplicate Detection Step </h1>

	<h3> Description </h3>
	<p>
		The Approximate Duplicate Detection Step allows the user to compute groups of records that represent the same real-world entity. <br>
		The step contains two different methods to compute the approximate duplicate records: a domain-independent approach and a rule-based approach.
	</p>

	<h3> Domain-Independent Algorithm </h3>
	<p> 
		The domain-independent algorithm allows the user to compute groups of approximate duplicate records without demanding domain-knowledge. <br>
		The user only needs to choose the similarity threshold from which a record will be considered approximate duplicate of another. This threshold should be a value between 0 and 1 where 0 means that the records may be completely different and 1 means that the records must be exactly the same.
